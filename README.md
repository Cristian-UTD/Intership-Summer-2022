# Intership Summer 2022

During the intership, I was taught how to make scripts in Bash Shell and made 2 applications in Python.
At intership I receive the following task:

For Bash Shell:
1. At a folder we have 10 files named 1.txt, 2.txt, ..., 10.txt, need a script to rename 3 files and make them hidden after to delete the rest of files and hidden files to make them unhidden.
2. Using again 10 files named 1.txt, 2.txt, ..., 10.txt, need to rename 3 files to word "apartament" (example apartament3.txt) and rest of files rename to word "house", after to delete the files with the word "house" and keep the files with word "apartament".
3. To create a script to which delete files from the folder where the script is located to delete file/s and to write in .txt file named "Log.txt" what file/s and what date they were deleted

For Python:
1. To create a application for a user to select a period for a vacation using a calendar made in app (similar to website Booking.com), writing his name and send a email for requesting vacation period selected from calendar.
