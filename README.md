# Intership Summer 2022

During the intership at Baum Engineering, I was taught how to make scripts and I did made scripts in Bash Shell like:
- move files
- rename files
- make .docx file
- delete specific one or more files
  
After I was taught how to programme in Python and did made 2 applications in Python:
First application was to make a app for a user to select a period for a vacation using a calendar made in app (similar to website Booking.com), writing his name and send a email to boss for requesting vacation period selected from calendar.
Second application to take car numbers with ITP date and Insurance date from another file using class and check them if the dates are expired and write on .docx file as a log if they are fined or not.
